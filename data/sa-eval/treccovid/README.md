For the "eval" evaluation, we used the [TREC-COVID dataset]([https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/RELISH-Aspire/19425506](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TRECCOVID-RF-Aspire/19425515)) as available in [Aspire project](https://github.com/allenai/aspire).
Since the dataset was not mapped to PMIDs in PubMed, we release our mapped version of the dataset. 
Please check "gold_*.txt" files in the zipped file.

For the "sa-eval" evaluation, we used the reduced version available in this folder.
Please check "eval_gold_*.txt" files in the zipped file.
